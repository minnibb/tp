## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/John Doe p/98765432`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

This is a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Current Implementation
The find feature parses the search keys given by the user, and finds all contacts that match the search key in the 
currently displayed list. These contacts are then returned and displayed in the UI. The sequence diagram below 
illustrates the interactions between the different components:
<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />


### Sort feature

#### Current Implementation
The sort feature parses the user-given parameters required for sorting, and displays the list of contacts in the UI in 
the user's preferred manner. The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the different components: 
<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />


### Favourite feature

#### Current Implementation
The favourite feature parses the index given by the user, and finds the contact with the matching index. This contact
is marked as a favourite (or unmarked as a favourite) and the changes are displayed in the UI. The sequence diagram 
below illustrates the interactions between the different components:
<puml src="diagrams/FavouriteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4

1. **Allow more than one parent’s name and phone number to be added to a student contact** 
   * The current issue allows only a single parent's name and phone number to the student contact. This is restrictive and there are cases where multiple guardians need to be recorded.<br>
   * We plan to modify the add and edit command to allow the user to input more than one parent’s name and phone number on a contact with a student role. <br>
2. **Allow more than one student’s name and phone number to be added to a parent contact** 
   * A parent can have multiple children in the same school, but the current system only allows a single student association.
   * We plan to modify the add and edit command to allow the user to input multiple student names and phone numbers on a contact with a parent role. <br>
3. **Allow missing Grade, Class, Relative’s Name and Relative’s Phone when using the Edit Command to change roles from Student to Parent or Parent to Student**
   * When changing a contact’s role to Student or Parent, the current edit command forces the user to add the grade, class, relative’s name and relative’s phone number fields. This is because these fields would not have been filled previously if the original role of the contact was Staff. However, if the original role of the contact is a Parent or a Student, these fields would have already been filled.<br>
   * We plan to modify the edit command to take into account the original role of the contact and allow these four fields to be missing when switching roles between Parent and Student. <br>
4. **Disallow users from editing fields when the input is the same as before:**
    * Currently, users can edit contact’s fields even when the input is identical to the existing values. This leads to unnecessary updates.
    * We plan to implement a check that prevents users from submitting a change if the input value matches the previous one.
5. **Enforce proper parent-student assignments:**
    * A single child can be assigned to more than two parents, which can cause data inconsistencies.
    * We plan to implement a rule that limits each child to a maximum of two parents, ensuring data integrity and reflecting realistic family structures.
6. **Provide clear feedback on missing command prefixes:**
    * Currently, when users forget to include required prefixes in their commands, the error messages are not specific enough to guide them effectively.
    * We plan to enhance the parser to detect missing prefixes and inform users exactly which ones are absent. This will improve user experience and reduce confusion when constructing commands.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### **Difficulty level**
Unlike AB3, which manages a single type of entity (persons), ClassHive categorizes contacts into students, parents, and senior management. It also introduces sorting and a favorite feature, adding complexity to data handling, commands, and UI design while ensuring ease of use for teachers.

### **Challenges Faced**
* Ensuring full test coverage for all features, especially for the UI components.
* Managing merge conflicts while collaborating as a team.
* Adhering to Checkstyle guidelines consistently.

### **Effort Required**
We reused portions of AB3's architecture and core functionality while adapting to our use case. For instance, we modified existing commands (Add,Delete,Edit) to handle the new command types and maintained the command-line interface. We added new features such as note-taking functionality for contacts, favourite contacts for quick access and more. Inclusive of adding and modifying test cases, the total time taken for each feature to be implemented or for an existing feature to be modified to fit our target audience was 5-6 hours.

### **Achievements**
* Transformed AB3 into ClassHive, a specialised tool for teachers.
* Enhanced usability with role-based contacts, sorting, and favourites.
* Easy-to-use application that simplifies contact management for teachers.
